     <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p>
            Across Africa, millions of people face chronic hunger and malnutrition. The issue stems from a complex web of challenges, including poverty, climate change, and insufficient access to resources. The impact of starvation affects not only individuals but entire communities, perpetuating cycles of poverty and limiting the potential for sustainable growth.
        </p>
        <h2>Why We Exist</h2>
        <p>
            We believe that access to food is a basic human right. Our mission is to raise awareness about the critical situation in Africa, provide accurate and actionable information, and inspire global communities to take meaningful action. By shedding light on the causes and consequences of starvation, we aim to rally support and bring about lasting change.
        </p>
        <h2>How You Can Help</h2>
        <p>
            Together, we can make a difference. Whether through donations, volunteering, or spreading the word, your involvement can bring hope to those in need. Explore our resources to learn more about the crisis and find ways to contribute to the solution.
