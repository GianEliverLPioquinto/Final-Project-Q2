     <li>Poverty and Economic Inequality
	 <p>Many African nations face widespread poverty, leaving families unable to afford 	 basic necessities, including food.</p>
	 <p>Limited access to resources such as arable land, credit, and education 	 	 exacerbates the problem.</p></li>
     <li>Climate Change and Environmental Challenges
	<p>Droughts and Desertification: Climate change has intensified droughts and 	desertification, reducing crop yields.</p>
	<p>Flooding: Unpredictable weather patterns, including severe flooding, destroy 	crops and displace communities.</p>
	<p>Soil Degradation: Overfarming, deforestation, and poor land management have led 	to declining soil fertility.</p></li>
     <li>Conflict and Instability
	<p>Ongoing conflicts in regions like the Sahel, South Sudan, and the Democratic 	Republic of Congo disrupt farming, food production, and distribution.</p>
	<p>Displaced populations often lose access to their livelihoods, further worsening 	food insecurity.</p></li>
     <li>Population Growth
	<p>Africa's rapidly growing population puts increasing pressure on food systems and 	natural resources.</p>
	<p>Urbanization also shifts dietary demands, leading to higher food prices in rural 	areas.</p></li>
     <li>Poor Infrastructure and Market Access
	<p>Inadequate transportation systems hinder the efficient distribution of food, 	leading to shortages in certain areas.</p>
	<p>Limited access to markets prevents farmers from selling surplus crops, reducing 	incomes and food availability.</p></li>
